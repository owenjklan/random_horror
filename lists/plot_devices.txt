ran from
hid from
stumbled upon
confession to make
found in the mail
in my dreams
in my nightmares
a year later
blackout
goes missing
wakes up
wasn't supposed to be this way
voyage at sea
nuclear war
plague outbreak
wasn't there before
never had one
things go wrong
aren't what they seem
role reversal
cannot escape
keeps following me
